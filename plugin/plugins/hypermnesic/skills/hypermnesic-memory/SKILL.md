description: Use whenever you need durable project or personal memory — recalling prior context, resolving a named entity to an existing note, or writing a note back. hypermnesic is a self-hosted memory layer (hybrid search/recall + a gated git-first write) served over an OAuth2-authenticated MCP endpoint.

# hypermnesic — the memory layer

hypermnesic indexes a git-tracked markdown vault and serves it over a self-hosted,
OAuth2-authenticated **MCP endpoint**. **Git is the source of truth**; the search index is a
disposable projection of the committed tree — a reindex never loses a committed note.

Reach for these tools whenever prior context, a known entity, or a durable note would help. A
relevance-gated recall hook may already surface related notes at prompt time, but call the tools
directly whenever you need more than it offered.

If the proactive hook does not inject context, do not infer that memory is absent. The hook is
silent by design on off-topic prompts, disabled hosts, missing configuration, auth expiry, timeouts,
degraded/no-hit reads, and parse failures. Owners can inspect that out-of-band with
`hooks/scripts/hypermnesic_hook_status.py status --json` or run
`hooks/scripts/hypermnesic_hook_status.py test-recall "<query>" --json`; those status surfaces are
for diagnosis, not prompt context.

## When to use it

- **Starting or continuing work** that would benefit from prior context → `search` /
  `build_context` / `think`.
- **Wikilinking a named entity** (a person, project, place, system) → `resolve` the name to an
  existing page, then link to it.
- **Capturing a durable note, decision, or summary** → `commit_note` (git-first, gated).

Hypermnesic is durable project memory. Use it for semantic memory, episodic/source memory,
procedural/policy memory, generated summaries, raw captures, and current-state mirrors that should
survive beyond the session as markdown/git truth.

Do not write behavioural preference memory to Hypermnesic by default. Example: "user likes terse replies" belongs in Honcho or an equivalent adjacent behavioural memory layer, not in durable
project memory. Do not write temporary session state, emotional inferences, secrets, credentials,
private keys, bearer tokens, or unreviewed sensitive material.

Before writing, preserve raw evidence. Cite source paths when consolidating; do not replace raw
captures with generated summaries. If the destination is unclear, call `list_folders` first and use
the returned writable folders and root-local agent guidance. Refusals are control signals: do not bypass protected-path,
frontmatter, dirty-tree, head-drift, consent, or scope refusals.

## The tools (MCP)

All read tools converge the index to the latest commit before answering, so a just-pushed note
is recall-able without a manual reindex.

- **`search(query, k=10)`** — hybrid (lexical + dense) search over the vault. Returns ranked hits
  with `path`, `heading`, `score`, `snippet`, `recency`.
- **`build_context(path, depth=1)`** — pages reachable from a note via its body `[[wikilinks]]`
  (incoming + outgoing). Use to expand around a hit.
- **`think(topic, k=8)`** — thinking-mode: related notes + Socratic prompts + tensions. Read-only
  (`wrote: false`); it never writes.
- **`resolve(name)`** — entity resolution: resolve a name to an existing page path, or `null` if
  ambiguous/missing — **never a wrong guess**. The result carries `slug` (the `.md`-stripped
  path); wikilink the slug, e.g. `[[infrastructure/hetzner]]`.
- **`list_folders(root="", depth=1)`** — discover the vault's folder taxonomy + writable
  locations before placing a note: child folders under `root` (drill-down to `depth` levels), each
  with its `writable` flag (matching exactly what `commit_note` accepts), `protected_reason`, and
  recursive `note_count`. The result also carries `agent_instruction`: `{source, content}` for a
  direct `AGENTS.md` at `root`, fallback direct `CLAUDE.md`, or `null` when neither exists. It does
  not bubble child-folder instruction files into parent listings. Read-only. Narrow `root` to drill
  deeper when `truncated` is true.

Tool routing:

- Use `search` for durable topic, entity, and project history.
- Use `build_context` after a promising hit when neighboring wikilinked notes matter.
- Use `think` for note-grounded exploration and related-but-unlinked pairs; it never writes.
- Use `resolve` before wikilinking a named entity; do not guess when it returns null.
- Use `list_folders` before writes when the path, writable surface, or local `AGENTS.md` /
  `CLAUDE.md` guidance is unclear.
- Use `commit_note` only for explicit durable writes that pass the taxonomy above.

Daily workflow routing:

- Use `capture` or the local `hypermnesic capture` CLI for low-friction raw-source intake.
- Treat triage as review-gated: suggest placement, links, and questions; do not silently move raw
  captures.
- Use the local `hypermnesic daily-review` CLI when an owner needs the scan-friendly capture ->
  triage -> recall -> write -> review -> clean up surface.
- Use memory-control commands for cleanup; do not create a second delete/revert path.

## Writing a note — `commit_note` (git-first, gated)

`commit_note(path, body, set_fields?, summary?)` is the **one sanctioned write path**. It is
**git-first**: it writes the file, commits it, and pushes — the index follows as a projection.
You never merge; the engine coordinates. It is gated:

- **Blocklist write surface (write-anywhere-under-guards):** by default a note may land
  **anywhere** in the vault *except* the protected classes below — there is no allowlist by
  default. An operator can still pass an explicit allowlist (e.g. `notes/`, `sources/`,
  `dashboards/`, `captures/`) to **narrow** where writes may land; omitted, the protected-path +
  governance fence is the sole bound. A refused path is **refused**, never silently dropped.
- **Protected-path + governance refusal (caller-independent):** governance/execution files and
  dirs — `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` anywhere, `.git/`, `.github/` (incl. CI workflows), `.obsidian/`,
  `scripts/`, `bin/`, `hooks/`, `skills/`, plus build/CI/credential file classes (`Dockerfile`,
  `Makefile`, `*.yml`/`*.yaml`/`*.lock`/`*.toml`, `.env*`, `package.json`) — are refused
  unconditionally, regardless of any allowlist.
- **Diff-or-die frontmatter gate:** an unintended frontmatter change aborts the write and
  surfaces the diff (no silent reserialization).
- A refusal returns `{committed: false, refused: "<reason>"}` — never a silent success.

For frictionless raw capture, prefer landing text under the free-append zone (commonly `sources/`).

## The disk-first model (why this is safe)

- **Git is the source of truth.** Every note is a committed markdown file; the index is a
  rebuildable projection. There is no separate database of record.
- **Reads are convergent.** The index catches up to `HEAD` before each read, so your own
  just-committed note is recall-able on the next query.
- **Writes are auditable and bounded.** `commit_note` is blocklist-bounded (write-anywhere
  except protected classes; an allowlist can narrow it), protected-path-guarded, frontmatter-stable,
  and audit-logged (summaries only, never bodies, never credentials).

## Auth

The MCP endpoint is OAuth2-authenticated. The plugin's MCP wiring presents your token
automatically; you never handle tokens by hand, and a token value never appears in a prompt, a
config file, or a log.

The auto-recall hook is separate from MCP tool auth. It reads `HYPERMNESIC_MCP_URL` for a bounded
read and only uses `HYPERMNESIC_MCP_TOKEN` when the hook route itself requires an HTTP credential;
the MCP tool wiring remains OAuth-discovery-only and does not require a static token.
